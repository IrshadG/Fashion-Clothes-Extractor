# Fashion-Clothes-Extractor
Identify upper and lower clothes from social media images

## About the project
Current fashion detection models aren't very useful for commercial or specific purposes. In this project, I'm working on getting info about fashion attributes like color, style and categories from social media pictures (I've already downloaded images from a few popular Instagram handles). I'm using various models from places like Hugging Face and GitHub, tweaking a few as needed. All these models use transformer-based machine learning architecture. It's an ongoing project, and I've already learned a bunch from it.
